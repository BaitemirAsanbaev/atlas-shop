Like a regular store, an online store implements the following main functions: presentation of goods (services) to the buyer, order processing, sale and delivery of goods.
      As a part of this project, requirements and limitations was analyzed. As a result, the Django framework was selected as a base solution of this project. The frontend part for this project is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The database solution selected is SQLite.
      The internal schema of the website and database was designed, according to the requirements. As for the front part, the website UI was designed according to the modern UI/UX design principles.
      The result of the project is a fully working website with the frontend interface part and backend logic. Codes and schemas for both backend and frontend parts are included in the project documentation.
